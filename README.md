# poc-root

This is the ROOT of the POC project. When you setup the POC, you should organize this project as the root of all other repos.

## Setup Steps

1. Clone this repo down into your local machine, wherever you like to keep your code projects
2. Once this project is cloned, run any clone Make command to clone the child repos that are part of the POC
3. Use Make commands while in this directory to run your sub projects/services. (Of course, you can also go directly to those directories to run project specific commands as well)

## Make Commands

Checkout the Makefile to see the list of available commands
